# Linux Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation occurs when a user gets access to more resources or functionality than they are normally allowed, and such elevation or changes should have been prevented by the application.

## Common Techniques

1. Kernel Exploits (Dirty Cow, etc.)
2. SUID Binaries
3. Sudo Rights (sudo -l)
4. Cron Jobs
5. Weak File Permissions (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd)
